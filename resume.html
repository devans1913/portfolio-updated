                    The Kansas City Public Schools (KCPS), through its Repurposing Initiative, is taking an innovative and comprehensive approach to promote the reuse/ redevelopment of 30 of its closed school sites. <br><br> The Repurposing Initiative, which began as a yearlong community engagement and planning process to develop community-driven reuse strategies, has transitioned from planning into action. <br><br> Guided by the community feedback and technical reuse assessments outlined in the reuse strategies, the KCPS is in the process of soliciting proposals and promoting opportunities to reposition these school sites so that they once again serve as valuable assets for the Kansas City community.

                                The program puts an emphasis on physical planning and urban design with community-based projects assigned over the course of the six-semester studio sequence. In the first year, students learn how to see the built environment through methods of design and graphic communication. In the second year, planning students develop their analytic skills through exercises in comparative urbanisms, typologies of urban fabric, site planning, planning program design and development. Students spend the last year of studio on planning for actual clients on real planning issues. The full range of planning knowledge, skills and values are taught in the variety of studio and lecture classes.
